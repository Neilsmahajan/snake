## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake.git
   cd snake
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
4. Create a topic branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Run the test suite to ensure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
4. Run formatting and linting:
   ```bash
   make fmt
   make vet
   ```
5. Test the game manually to ensure it works as expected

### Committing Changes

1. Write good commit messages:

   - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
   - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
   - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

2. Example commit message:

   ```
   Add multiplayer support for Snake game

   - Implement network communication between players
   - Add lobby system for matchmaking
   - Update game loop to handle multiple snakes

   Closes #123
   ```

### Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```
2. Create a pull request on GitHub
3. Wait for review and address any feedback

## Styleguides

### Go Styleguide

- Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Run `go vet` to catch common errors
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  - üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

## Code Architecture Guidelines

### Package Organization

- Follow the existing package structure
- Keep packages focused on a single responsibility
- Use the `internal/` directory for packages that shouldn't be imported by other projects
- Place the main application entry point in `cmd/`

### Error Handling

- Return errors rather than panicking
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf`
- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Use sentinel errors for expected error conditions

### Concurrency

- Use channels for communication between goroutines
- Avoid shared memory where possible
- Use proper synchronization primitives when shared memory is necessary
- Always clean up goroutines properly

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test error conditions
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested
